PROGRAM RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS :
At first user will input number of vertices.
Then program will ask you to input your network flow diagram.
For this, You have to input all the edges of Graph with there capacity as three space separated integers.
For example for edge(i to j) with capacity C , you will give input "i j C" and then press Enter
Do the same for all edges until you are done.
Once you are done, Enter -1 to stop taking further inputs.

Now the program will ask you to enter the source and sink vertex, give that input.

Finally the program will tell you the maximum flow from source to sink vertex.
Program ends successfully :-)
